# Nitrokey solo2 fork

Nitrokey fork of the SoloKeys Solo 2 monorepo.

**WARNING WARNING WARNING**
- **EARLY PRERELEASE.**
- **NOT FOR PUBLIC USE.**
- **PULL REQUESTS / ISSUES ONLY AFTER INITIAL CONSULTATION WITH THE TEAM.**

----

This repository is temporarily used to keep track of Nitrokey modifications to
the solo2 monorepo until it is split up into separate components.  The `main`
branch is tracking the upstream `main` branch.  The Nitrokey modifications are
located on the `nitrokey-main` branch which is regularily rebased onto `main`
to keep up with the upstream changes.

To keep the commit history simple until the repository is split up, only merge
pull requests using the *Rebase and merge* or *Squash and merge* strategies.
Please group changes into logically atomic commits to make it easier to rebase
them.

----

To make pcsclite on Linux work with the Bee, on Debian copy `Info.plist` to `/etc/libccid_Info.plist`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for your system.

- Install dependencies such as clang, llvm, arm-none-eabi-gdb, flip-link

- Get and prepare hardware
- Run `make build-dev`.

For more information: <https://hackmd.io/@solokeys/solo2-getting-started>.
Please **do not** send PRs to expand on getting started generalities, just edit the linked HackMD directly.


### Boards

Head to [runnners/lpc55/board](runners/lpc55/board) for an overview on the possible embedded platforms the firmware
currently supports.

### Compiling

Head to [runners/lpc55](runners/lpc55) to get started, and try `make build-dev`, which compiles
the entire firmware bundle using features convenient for getting started.

With `make run-dev`, it will try to connect to a GDB server to flash and run the firmware.
One way to run a GDB server is `JLinkGDBServer -strict -device LPC55S69 -if SWD -vd`

To enable logs, you can change the feature flags on each crate.  Then logs will be output via semihosting to your SWD debugger.
```
# Enable logs on the root crate and a few of the local crate dependencies.
cargo run --release --features board-lpcxpresso55,log-all,fido-authenticator/log-all,ctaphid-dispatch/log-info,ctap-types/log-all
```
